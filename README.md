# physicsSim
physics sim/game thing

# Controls:
-wasd+space, move

-mouse, look

# TODO
# Controls:
-handle inputs fron event into function instead of using other checks.

# Features:
-improve code legibility(split up large functions)

-add more descriptive comments

-zoom control(implimented in editor)

-texture offset & rotation

-backround objects that move at different rate than foreground (and posibly objects in front of foreground if feasable

-object groups(objects stuck together)

-glue(objects without colision attatched to other objects)

-some sort of hinges

-improve physics/reduce jitter

-make friction more believable

-possibly redo physics code to work better

-improve texture caching to reduce repeated texture loads (same texture loaded multiple times)

-load trigger

-expload trigger
